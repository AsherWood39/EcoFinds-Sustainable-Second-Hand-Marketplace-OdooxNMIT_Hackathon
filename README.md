## Running the Project with Vite

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast development and easy deployment.

### Setup Steps

1. **Install Node.js**
	- Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Install dependencies**
	- Open a terminal in the project folder and run:
	  ```sh
	  npm install
	  ```

3. **Start the development server**
	- Run:
	  ```sh
	  npm run dev
	  ```
	- The site will open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (default).

4. **Build for production**
	- Run:
	  ```sh
	  npm run build
	  ```
	- The output will be in the `dist` folder.

5. **Preview the production build**
	- Run:
	  ```sh
	  npm run preview
	  ```
	- This will serve the built site locally for testing.
